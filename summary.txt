* Russian coup attempt was unsuccessful, but could have reached Moscow outskirts without deal.
* The brief insurgency revealed the Kremlin's inability to provide an effective rapid response, highlighting internal Russian security weaknesses.
**Summary:**

* A mercenary group called Wagner was reportedly on the verge of reaching Moscow before being stopped by a deal between the group's leader and President Vladimir Putin.
* The group's march was likely the result of surprise combined with the impact of heavy losses in Ukraine.

**Details:**

The Wagner Group is a private military company that is reportedly linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The group has been involved in a number of conflicts around the world, including in Syria and Ukraine.

In recent weeks, there have been reports that the Wagner Group was on the verge of reaching Moscow. The group was reportedly marching towards the capital city from the south, and it was believed that they were only a few hundred miles away.

However, the march was reportedly stopped by a deal between the Wagner Group's leader, Yevgheny Prigozhin, and President Putin. The deal reportedly called for the Wagner Group to withdraw from Moscow and to return to their base in Syria.

The reasons for the Wagner Group's march towards Moscow are not entirely clear. However, it is possible that the group was trying to take advantage of the chaos in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. It is also possible that the group was trying to assassinate President Putin.

Whatever the reason for the march, it is clear that the Wagner Group was a serious threat to the Russian government. The group's presence near Moscow would have caused a great deal of panic and instability.

The fact that the Wagner Group was stopped by a deal between Prigozhin and Putin suggests that the Russian government was aware of the threat posed by the group. It is also possible that the deal was an attempt by the Russian government to buy time to deal with the Wagner Group.

The Wagner Group's march towards Moscow is a reminder of the threat posed by private military companies. These companies are often used by governments to carry out tasks that they would prefer to keep secret. They are also often used to carry out operations that are illegal or unethical.

The Wagner Group is just one example of a private military company that is operating around the world. These companies pose a serious threat to peace and security, and they need to be regulated more effectively.
